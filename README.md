# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my personal cybersecurity projects that I've developed while advancing my knowledge through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program and preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification. These projects reflect my passion for cybersecurity and my commitment to applying what I've learned in practical, real-world scenarios.

## About Me

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast dedicated to understanding and improving the security landscape of digital technologies. My journey began with the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, where I gained a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles, network security, and threat management. Currently, I'm enhancing my expertise by studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification to further solidify my understanding of industry-standard practices.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Small Business Security Audits  (NIST CSF Security Control Assessment)

A comprehensive Security Control Assessment Tool aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. This tool aims to help businesses evaluate their security posture and take steps to protect, detect, and respond to threats effectively.


- ***Organized Assessment Table:*** The tool provides a detailed table of security controls categorized by NIST CSF functions.
- ***Comprehensive Evaluation:*** Helps businesses assess current controls, identify gaps, and understand risk levels.
- ***Free Download:*** Available for anyone to download and use for self-assessment.


### 2. Securing Web Applications

Revisiting my previous web applications, I've focused on integrating security from the ground up. Key improvements include:

- **Input Validation**: Implementing strict validation to prevent SQL injection.
- **Authentication Enhancements**: Strengthening user authentication mechanisms with multi-factor authentication.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Ensuring data encryption in transit and at rest.
- **Code Review**: Analyzing code for security flaws and optimizing for better protection.

### 3. Phishing Awareness Posters

To educate employees about the dangers of phishing, network security, and the importance of two-factor authentication (2FA), I've designed a series of informative posters. This project encompassed:

- **Educational Content Creation**: Developing clear and concise information on phishing tactics and how to avoid them.
- **Visual Design**: Crafting eye-catching and engaging visuals to effectively communicate key messages.
- **Awareness Campaign**: Strategizing the placement and distribution of posters to maximize employee engagement and retention.
- **Feedback Collection**: Gathering input from employees to improve future educational materials.

## Skills and Technologies

- **Security Frameworks**: Familiar with NIST CSF standards.
- **Tools**:
  - Google Sheets
  - Figma 
- **Programming Languages**:
  - JavaScript
  - SQL
- **Threat Analysis**: Skilled in identifying and mitigating potential threats and vulnerabilities.


## Goals and Aspirations

My aim is to contribute to the cybersecurity field by developing secure applications and helping organizations protect their digital assets. I'm eager to collaborate with other professionals, learn new technologies, and stay updated with the evolving cybersecurity landscape.
