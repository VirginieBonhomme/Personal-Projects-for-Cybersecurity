# Phishing Awareness Poster Series: Cybersecurity Education

## Project Overview
As an intern at IQEQ Law, I developed a comprehensive Phishing Awareness Poster Series aimed at educating the firm's employees about the risks of phishing, enhancing network security, and promoting the use of two-factor authentication (2FA). This initiative allowed me to leverage my expertise in educational content creation, visual design, and campaign strategy to foster a culture of security awareness within the legal firm.

## Project Details

### Educational Content Creation
I crafted clear, concise, and accessible information detailing common phishing tactics, best practices for network security, and strategies for safeguarding sensitive data. My objective was to present the information in a manner that is easily understandable for all employees, regardless of their technical background.

### Visual Design
To ensure the posters effectively captured attention and encouraged engagement, I employed vibrant and engaging visuals that clearly illustrate key cybersecurity concepts. Each poster features eye-catching designs with minimalistic icons and high-contrast colors, highlighting the critical importance of the cybersecurity topics addressed.

### Awareness Campaign Strategy
I strategically arranged the placement of these posters throughout IQEQ Law’s break rooms and other high-traffic areas where employees are likely to take breaks and absorb the information. This placement strategy ensures that the security messages receive repeated exposure, thereby enhancing retention and promoting secure behavior among staff members.

### Feedback and Iteration
Throughout the project, I solicited feedback from employees to assess the effectiveness of the posters. This input enabled me to refine the designs and improve the messaging for subsequent iterations, ensuring that the content remained relevant, engaging, and impactful for the firm’s workforce.
