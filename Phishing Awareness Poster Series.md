# Phishing Awareness Poster Series: Cybersecurity Education

## Project Overview
As part of my journey into cybersecurity, I designed a series of **Phishing Awareness Posters** to educate employees about the dangers of phishing, network security, and the importance of two-factor authentication (2FA). This project allowed me to combine my skills in educational content creation, visual design, and campaign strategy to promote a culture of security awareness.

## Project Details

### Educational Content Creation
I developed clear, concise, and accessible information on common phishing tactics, network security practices, and methods for protecting sensitive data. My goal was to ensure the messages were easy to understand, even for those with minimal technical knowledge.

### Visual Design
To capture attention and encourage engagement, I used vibrant, engaging visuals that illustrate key concepts. Each poster is designed to be eye-catching yet informative, using minimalistic icons and high-contrast colors to emphasize the importance of the cybersecurity topics covered.

### Awareness Campaign Strategy
I strategically planned the distribution of these posters across the workplace, placing them in high-traffic areas where employees are likely to pause and read. This ensures repeated exposure to the messages, increasing retention and encouraging secure behavior.

### Feedback and Iteration
Throughout the project, I gathered feedback from employees on the effectiveness of the posters. This allowed me to refine my designs and improve the messaging for future iterations, ensuring the content remained relevant and engaging.

## Poster Series Highlights
