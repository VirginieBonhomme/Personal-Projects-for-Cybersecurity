# Introduction
When I first started building my Rare Gems web application, which allows users to discover rare sneakers and leave reviews, I didn’t fully understand the importance of security. At the time, I was focused on getting the app to work and didn’t consider how vulnerabilities in the app could lead to data breaches or attacks.

Now that I’ve learned about threat modeling and basic security practices, I realize how critical it is to secure applications from the start. I’m a beginner in both development and cybersecurity, so I’ve been using a framework called PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) to better understand where potential vulnerabilities could occur and how to address them.

# PASTA Worksheet for Rare Gems Application

| **Stages**                        | **Sneaker Company**                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **I. Define Business and Security Objectives** | 1. **User Reviews:** The app allows users to create, update, and delete reviews of rare sneakers, ensuring user data integrity is critical.<br>2. **Sneaker Data Storage:** The app uses an internal database to store sneaker information, so protecting this data from unauthorized access is essential.<br>3. **User Authentication:** The app requires secure user authentication and session management to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts. |
| **II. Define the Technical Scope**            | **Technologies used by the application:** <br>1. SQL Database <br>2. SHA-256 Encryption <br>3. Web Application Interface <br> **Why prioritize these technologies?** <br> The SQL database is prioritized for efficiently managing and storing sneaker information and user reviews. SHA-256 encryption ensures that sensitive user data, such as passwords, is securely stored. The web application interface is crucial for user interaction, allowing them to browse sneakers and manage reviews. |
| **III. Decompose Application**               | **Data Flow Diagram:** <br>1. **User → Web App:** User searches for rare sneakers or submits a review. <br>2. **Web App → Database:** Fetches sneaker information or stores user reviews. |
| **IV. Threat Analysis**                      | **Types of Threats:** <br>1. **Internal Threats:** SQL injection attacks that could compromise the integrity of user reviews and sneaker data. <br>2. **External Threats:** Session hijacking, where an attacker could gain unauthorized access to user accounts and manipulate stored data. |
| **V. Vulnerability Analysis**                | **Vulnerabilities:** <br>1. **Code Vulnerabilities:** Lack of prepared statements in SQL queries, which could lead to SQL injection attacks. <br>2. **Authentication Flaws:** Weak session management, making the app susceptible to session hijacking. |
| **VI. Attack Modeling**                      | **Attack Tree:** <br>- **Root Node: User Data** <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - **Branch 1: SQL Injection** <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - **Sub-Branch: Lack of Prepared Statements** <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - **Branch 2: Session Hijacking** <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - **Sub-Branch: Weak Login Credentials** |
| **VII. Risk Analysis and Impact**            | **Security Controls:** <br>1. Prepared Statements: Prevent SQL injection attacks by securing database queries. <br>2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Add an extra layer of security for user authentication. <br>3. Input Validation and Sanitization: Prevent XSS and other input-based attacks. <br>4. Session Timeout and Management: Implement secure session expiration to reduce the risk of session hijacking. |
