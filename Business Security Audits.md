# NIST CSF Security Control Assessment Tool for Small Businesses

I developed a user-friendly **Security Control Assessment Tool** tailored specifically to small businesses, aligned with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. This tool empowers organizations to evaluate their security posture across key cybersecurity functions: **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond,** and **Recover**. It helps businesses proactively manage cybersecurity risks, identify vulnerabilities, and strengthen their overall defenses.

## Key Features:

- **Organized Assessment Table**:  
  The tool provides a clear, structured table that breaks down security controls based on the NIST CSF functions, ensuring a systematic approach to cybersecurity.

- **Comprehensive Evaluation**:  
  Businesses can assess existing security measures, identify gaps, and understand their risk exposure. This evaluation supports better decision-making and more effective security practices.

- **Free and Accessible**:  
  The tool is available as a **free download**, making it accessible to businesses of any size for self-assessment and continuous improvement.

This project serves as a practical solution for small businesses looking to enhance their cybersecurity without requiring extensive technical expertise or expensive third-party assessments.
